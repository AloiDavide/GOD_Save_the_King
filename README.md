# GOD_Save_the_King
 A proof of concept prototype for a Fire Emblem inspired strategic RPG developed by me and 4 other students for my Software Engineering course.

## Fair use disclaimer
"GOD Save the King" is not currently a commercial product.
The prototype contains assets (such as backgrounds, tilesets, and 2D sprites) sourced from the web due to the lack of resources of the development team.
No license will be provided unless the assets are replaced with original or properly licensed ones.
